# Flight Booking Data Analysis Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze a flight booking dataset obtained from a platform used to book flight tickets. The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights that will be of immense value to passengers. This will be achieved through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and the application of machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `Flight Booking Price Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis process, including data cleaning, EDA, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.
- `data/`: Folder containing the flight booking dataset and any other related data files.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation (this file).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies and libraries required to run the project.
## Data

The dataset includes various features related to flight bookings, such as:


- Airline : Name of the airline company
- Flight : Plane's flight code
- Source City : City from which the flight takes off
- Departure Time : Time of Departure
- Stops : Number of stops between the source and destination cities
- Arrival Time : Time of Arrival
- Destination City : City where the flight will land
- Class : Contains information on seat class
- Duration : Overall amount of time taken to travel between cities in hours.
- Days : left Subtracting the trip date by the booking date.
- Price : Ticket price


## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Visualization of key features
   - Identifying patterns and trends
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Hypothesis testing
4. **Machine Learning:**
   - Model selection and training (e.g., regression, classification)
   - Model evaluation and validation
   - Feature importance and interpretation

## Results

- Key findings from the EDA and statistical analysis.
- Performance metrics of the machine learning models.
- Insights and recommendations for passengers based on the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HrHarsh59/flight-booking-analysis.git
   cd flight-booking-analysis
